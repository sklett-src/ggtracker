class PaymentController < ApplicationController
  include ActiveMerchant::Billing::Integrations

# Here's how payment integration works.
# The Paypal buttons on the ggtracker site include a parameter called 'custom' and put the user id in there.
# After the user signs up for a subscription, Paypal POSTS to us at backend/ipn.
# We set their paypal_profile_id here and turn on their prolevel here.
#
# Later, if they cancel through our settings page, home_controller#cancelled_pro is
# called.  That uses the paypal_profile_id and the Paypal API to
# cancel their subscription.
#
# Or if they cancel on Paypal, we get an IPN notification and process it here.
#
# Smart things we could do someday:
#
# * record the exact date of each subscription and cancellation (some
#   users subscribe and cancel multiple times, so record each one
#   separately).  Then we can have subscription/cancellation analytics
#   to track how product improvements drive performance.
#
# * use this IPN interface to keep track of user payments.  when it's
#   30 days after their last payment, that's when Pro status should
#   turn off.
