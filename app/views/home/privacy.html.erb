<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p>
Hi!  Here are the details about how gggreplays manages your personal information. By using the GGGReplays website (the Site), you consent to the data practices described here.
</p>
<h2>
Information Collected
</h2>
<p>
You provide GGGReplays with personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, battle.net URL and character codes.  GGGReplays’s game information comes from the replays you provide, and directly from the Starcraft 2 game systems.  When you access the Site or open one of our emails, we automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology, such as Google Analytics. This information includes which pages you look at, your IP address, browser type, access times, which web site you came from, and what search terms you used.
</p>
<h2>
Use of Information

<p>
GGGReplays uses the information we collect to keep in touch with you, to operate and improve the service, and to conduct statistical research about Starcraft and GGGReplays.  We may send you promotional emails about GGGReplays from time to time.  You may opt out of those emails by emailing “UNSUBSCRIBE” to gggreplays@gmail.com.
</p>
<p>
GGGReplays does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to anyone without your permission.
</p>
<p>
GGGReplays may disclose your personal information, without notice, under special circumstances, such as to comply with court orders requiring us to do so or if the Men in Black arrive.
</p>
<p>
In the event GGGReplays is acquired by or merged with another company, we will transfer the information we have collected to them.  We will notify you by email in advance and give you at least two weeks to ask us to remove your information from our records before the transfer.
</p>
<h2>Security of your Personal Information</h2>

We follow generally accepted industry standards to keep your personal information secure.  We do not retain credit card or Paypal account information on our servers.  Regardless of the precautions taken by us, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you transmit such information at your own risk.
