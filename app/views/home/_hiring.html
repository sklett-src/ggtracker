<b>We're Hiring a Full-Stack Developer</b>
<br><br>
Every day, thousands of StarCraft players use GGTracker to analyze their games and get better faster.  We worked with Blizzard to <a href="http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/9669862/">extend the replay file format</a> and <a href="http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/10811186/wcs-now-supports-ggtracker-analytics-8-30-2013">enhance their tournament videos</a>.
<br><br>
Now we're building a next-generation automated coaching system, starting with StarCraft.

<b>Automated coaching? You can't be serious.</b>

It's for real serious!

We are going to build the world's first automated sports coaching system.  The same principles that are used in automated finance, voice recognition and self-driving cars can be used to analyze a player's strengths and weaknesses.  We are already working with several well-known StarCraft coaches to design scripted coaching systems.
