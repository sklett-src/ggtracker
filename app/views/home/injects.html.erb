66.4%.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">So yes, higher-league players have a higher Inject % than lower-league players. &nbsp;But not by much!</span><span class="c2">&nbsp; Even where the difference is largest, at the 12 minute mark, Masters score an average 66.4% and Silver players an average 61.3%. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s a difference of 5.1%, which is not much when you consider that the overall population of both Silver and Master games have a standard deviation of 11-13%. &nbsp;The standard deviation is twice as large as the

class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">How can this be?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c7 c2 c3">The Theory</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Here&rsquo;s a theory: injects matter a lot in the early game, and then matter less and less.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span >Injects are important because they keep you from getting larva-blocked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Larva-blocked&rdquo; means you want to make units but you can&#39;t because you have no larva.</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >Zerglings are the most larva-intensive unit in terms of larva per 1000 minerals. &nbsp;To make 1000 resources-worth of zerglings you need 20 larva. &nbsp;To make 1000 resources-worth of Ultralisks, you need 2 larva. &nbsp;That&#39;s 10x less larva per resource!</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >Injects matter less after the beginning of the game for two reasons:</span></p><p class="c5"><span >1) The larva-to-resource ratio is highest for zerglings and drones, which are most important at the beginning of the game.</span></p><p class="c5"><span >2) Once a location is mined out, the hatch at that location keeps supplying larva, also reducing the possibility of larva blockage. &nbsp;So in late game, even without consistent injects you may not get larva blocked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >Another reason people can avoid getting larva-blocked without having perfect injects is that people make macro hatches, which steadily supply larva, reducing the possibility of larva blockage. &nbsp;By making a macro hatch you are spending 350 minerals (don&rsquo;t forget the drone) in order to reduce the need to focus your APM and attention on perfect injects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >At some point in any game, the regular flow of larva you get from your hatches, including mined-out hatches, is enough to supply the larva you need for the resources you are producing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >Let&rsquo;s ignore minerals vs gas for the moment and just consider the resource per larva cost of various Zerg units. &nbsp;Zerglings and drones are 50 resources per larva. &nbsp;Roaches and overlords are 100. &nbsp;Hydras are 150, Mutalisks are 200. &nbsp;The mighty Ultralisk is 500 resources per larva.</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >Let&rsquo;s say we want to make an army out of units that average 100 resources per larva. &nbsp;How good do our injects need to be in order to avoid getting larva-blocked?</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >A fully-saturated base gathers 861 minerals/minute and 242 gas/minute = 1103 resources/minute.</span><span >&nbsp; A queen can generate enough energy to inject larva once every 44.44 seconds, which creates 4 larva. &nbsp;So that&#39;s 11.11 seconds for a larva, or 5.4 larva per minute. &nbsp;Together with the 4 larva per minute from the hatch itself, that&rsquo;s 9.4 larva per minute, which is not quite the 11 larva per minute we&#39;d need.</span></p><p class="c1"><span ></span></p><p class="c5"><span >But if we have any macro hatches, or any hatches that are mined out, or any bases less than fully saturated, or we&#39;re making units more expensive than 100 resources per larva, then we don&#39;t need perfect injects.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">After the early game, we will tend to make units that use more resources per larva, and we will have mined-out hatches that are still producing larva. &nbsp;For both reasons, perfect injects become less important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span

c3"><br></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c3">Exactly how is Inject % Computed?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">Inject % = (total # of minutes all hatches spent with injected larva) / (total # of minutes all hatches were active)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span >A hatch is considered active from the first time a Queen injects it until the last time the hatch is selected by anyone for any reason, or the game ends. &nbsp;If we can someday get the actual hatch death time, we will use that instead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">For example, let&rsquo;s say you had two hatches in a game that you won. &nbsp;The first one got its first inject at 4:45, and the second one at 7:45. &nbsp;You won the game at 10:45. &nbsp;So your first hatch was active for six minutes, and the second one for three minutes. &nbsp;So that&rsquo;s nine total minutes that hatches were alive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">And let&rsquo;s say you did six injects on the first hatch and three on the second. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s nine injects total, and each inject lasts for 40 seconds. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s six total minutes of injects being active. &nbsp;So your inject % for that game is 6/9 = 66.6%.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c3">Why don&rsquo;t you simply correlate Win % to Inject %? &nbsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t that show us if injects matter for winning games?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">This could be done, but it&rsquo;s very easy to do it wrong because of how the ladder system works.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>The ladder system puts you up against harder opponents every time you win, and easier opponents every time you lose. &nbsp;It attempts to push everyone&#39;s winrate to 50%.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Let&rsquo;s do a thought experiment, a mental model. &nbsp;Suppose that inject % really is an important skill, and there are nine other important skills, and the skills are all correlated but not perfectly.. &nbsp;And let&rsquo;s say that the winner of any game is whoever is more skilled, plus some random noise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>Since the ladder system is in effect, players would gradually migrate to the spot on the ladder corresponding to the rank of their skills, with the noise causing random fluctuations in ladder/MMR rank.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>When two people play against each other on the ladder, they have approximately equal MMR. &nbsp;Since they are meeting on ladder and have approximately equal MMR, the expected win% is 50% for each. &nbsp;If one of them has better inject skill (or in general, better race macro), then, </span><span class="c13">since they have approximately equal MMR</span><span>, the other player must have superiority in other skills to compensate. &nbsp;Therefore we would not see any correlation between win% and inject%, even though in this model inject% is important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span></span></p><p class="c5"><span>However, in this same thought experiment, note that there will be a relationship between inject% and MMR. &nbsp;Since MMR is related to league, which we can observe, we would expect to see that higher-league players have higher inject%.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">This same argument applies to analysis of any other skill variable. &nbsp;That is why </span><span class="c7

class="c5"><span class="c2">We have fewer Grandmaster and Bronze games (641 GM), so there&rsquo;s a lot of up and down noise in the averages. &nbsp;The averages for GM and Bronze don&rsquo;t contradict our conclusions at all, but it makes the graphs more distracting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2 c3">Why not look at the absolute # of injects rather than the inject %?</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c2">That would be interesting! &nbsp;I would expect that higher-league players indeed have more bases sooner, and do more
