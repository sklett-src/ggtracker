      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p><b>Most of my games aren't here, LOL.</b></p>
      <p>GGTracker only knows about the games that you (or your opponent) uploads.</p>
      <p><b>Sometimes my Spending Skill doesn't seem to line up with my SQ. What's up with that?</b></p>
      <p>Your Spending Skill is based on typical SQ levels for your race, region (NA, EU, etc) and game length. As you can see from the <a href="http://ggtracker.com/spending_skill_stats">Spending Skill Stats</a>, long games tend to have lower SQs.  For example, an SQ of 76 for an EU Protoss in a 27-minute game is a Grandmaster-level performance, but in a 7-minute game that same SQ is only Platinum level.</p>
      <p><b>How do I share my player profile page with someone?</b></p>
      <p>Just send them the link!  All player pages and match pages on GGTracker are public.</p>
      <p><b>I'm playing in several regions.  How do I add my account for the other regions I play in?</b></p>
      <p>Each region (EU, NA, SEA, KR, CN) is a different battle.net profile.  GGTracker Pro users can have multiple battle.net profiles in a single GGTracker account.</p>

      <p><b>How do I get the battle.net link for my account in another region?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Upload a game that you played in the other region.</li>
        <li>The GGTracker page for the match will appear.</li>
        <li>Click on your name in that match page.  Now the GGTracker page for your profile in that region will appear.</li>
        <li>Click on the BNET link under your name.</li>
        <li>Now you're on the battle.net page for your profile in that region.  Copy the link from the browser address bar.</li>
      </ul>

      <p id="delete"><b>How do I delete a match?</b></p>
      <p>Logged-in authenticated users can delete matches that they played in using the "DELETE" link on the match page, just below the map name.</p>
      <p style="text-align: center"><%= image_tag "deletebutton.png" %></p>
      <p id="spending_skill_right"><b>Is Spending Skill right?  My Spending Skill is higher than the league I'm in.</b></p>
      <p>Yes, it's right.  Player skills vary widely, and your Spending Skill in a particular game or on average might be different from the league you're in.  See <a href="http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/viewmessage.php?topic_id=329510&currentpage=3#55">this discussion</a> on TeamLiquid for more.</p>

    <p><b>How do I use the auto-uploader?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Download the auto-uploader: <a class="action button" href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/auto-uploader/ggtracker+uploader.zip">download</a></li>
<li>Unzip it and start the version appropriate to your operating system.</li>
<li>Click the Choose... button and pick a directory.  The auto-uploader will watch that directory and its subdirectories for new replays.</li>
<li>Paste this code: <span class="token"><%= current_user.access_token %></span> into the Upload key field in the Auto-uploader window.</li>
<li>Play Starcraft!  The auto-uploader will watch for any new replays and upload them to ggtracker.</li>
</ul>
