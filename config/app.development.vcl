# Shortened/modified version of: https://gist.github.com/3305056
# TODO: eventually bring back grace/health checks, they might be useful.
#
# FIXME: we had to downgrade to 2.1.3 on EY, so this VCL will no longer work 
# without small modifications. Running 3.0.x locally though, so I'll leave
# it here for now.
